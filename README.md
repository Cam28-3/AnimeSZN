# AnimeSZN

An agentic RAG application for anime discovery and recommendation. An LLM agent reasons about
a user's request, chooses tools (title search, semantic search, similarity search), and checks
community reception before recommending a title — rather than surfacing anything with a
passable raw score. Full design doc: `Anime RAG Agent/Architecture.md` (Obsidian).

**Status:** full pipeline working end-to-end (ingestion → embeddings → review summarization →
agent → API → frontend). Data source recently migrated from Jikan (the unofficial MyAnimeList
API, shutting down October 2026) to AniList's GraphQL API. Metadata (21,971 titles) and
embeddings are fully re-ingested against the new source; review summarization still needs a
full-scale re-run — see [Known gaps](#known-gaps--next-steps).

## Requirements

- Python 3.11+, Node 18+
- PostgreSQL with the [pgvector](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector) extension
- Redis (for background job queueing — batch scripts currently run synchronously via CLI, not yet wired through RQ)
- Anthropic API key (with billing/credits enabled) and Voyage AI API key

## Setup

```bash
cd backend
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

cp .env.example .env
# edit .env: set DATABASE_URL to your local Postgres user/db, add ANTHROPIC_API_KEY and VOYAGE_API_KEY

createdb anime_szn
psql -d anime_szn -c "CREATE EXTENSION vector;"
alembic upgrade head

cd ../frontend
npm install
```

If `CREATE EXTENSION vector` fails with "extension is not available," pgvector isn't installed
against your Postgres build. `brew install pgvector` only ships bottles for the newest one or two
Postgres major versions — if you're on an older major version, build it from source:

```bash
git clone --branch v0.8.4 https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector.git
cd pgvector
make PG_CONFIG=$(brew --prefix postgresql@16)/bin/pg_config
make install PG_CONFIG=$(brew --prefix postgresql@16)/bin/pg_config
```

## Running it

```bash
# backend
cd backend
source venv/bin/activate
uvicorn app.main:app --port 8000

# frontend, in another terminal
cd frontend
npm run dev   # http://localhost:5173
```

## Data pipeline (offline/batch, run in this order)

All idempotent — safe to re-run; each only processes rows missing that stage's output. Run from
`backend/` with the venv active.

```bash
# 1. Metadata: fetch from AniList (GraphQL, year-sliced crawl), transform, upsert
python -m ingestion.ingest                     # full catalog (rate-limited, ~30 req/min, slow)
python -m ingestion.ingest --start-year 2020    # resume/limit to a later starting year

# 2. Embeddings: Voyage AI, synopsis + genres/tags -> pgvector column
python -m ingestion.embed

# 3. Validate retrieval quality before trusting the agent's tool results
python -m eval.run_eval

# 4. Review summarization: AniList reviews -> Claude Haiku (Batch API) -> reception_signals
python -m ingestion.summarize_reception
# if it times out waiting on the batch, resume later:
python -m ingestion.summarize_reception --resume <batch_id>
```

## Agent

`app/agent/loop.py` runs the tool-use loop (capped at 3 tool-call rounds, then a forced
`respond` call) using `search_by_title`, `semantic_search`, `find_similar`, `check_reception`,
and a final `respond` tool that the model must call to structure its answer.
Reception caveats are backstopped in code (`_fallback_caveat`) — if the model recommends a
`mixed`/`widely_criticized` title without writing a caveat itself, one is generated from the
stored reception summary so a divisive title is never surfaced silently.

## API

- `POST /recommend` — `{"query": "..."}` → agent message + structured recommendation cards
- `GET /anime/{id}` — full metadata + reception summary for a single title

## Known gaps / next steps

- **Full-catalog ingest needs a fresh run against AniList.** The previous ~30,200-title catalog
  was Jikan-sourced and is stale/being replaced now that the pipeline points at AniList instead
  (Jikan is shutting down October 2026). `ingestion/ingest.py` needs a full unattended run
  (year-sliced crawl, ~30 req/min) before the catalog is back to full breadth.
- **No scheduled catalog refresh.** Ingestion/embeddings/reception are only ever run manually —
  there's no cron/launchd job or RQ/Redis schedule re-running them (e.g. weekly/monthly, as the
  original architecture doc intended). The catalog is a static snapshot from whenever someone
  last ran `ingestion/ingest.py` by hand; new releases, score changes, and status transitions
  (e.g. airing → finished) won't show up until it's manually re-run.
- Review summarization (`ingestion/summarize_reception.py`) needs a full-scale re-run against
  AniList reviews once the catalog is re-ingested (~$25 est. cost, ~8-12hr wall-clock, same
  order of magnitude as the original Jikan-based run). Until it's run at full scale,
  `check_reception` has no real data for most titles, so the agent's reception commentary on
  those is unverified model knowledge, not the sourced signal the whole project is built around.
- RQ/Redis job queue not wired up — batch scripts run directly via CLI (same root cause as the
  scheduling gap above)
- `search_by_title` uses plain `ILIKE`, not proper fuzzy matching (e.g. pg_trgm)
- No automated tests beyond the retrieval eval
